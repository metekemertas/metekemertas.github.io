I am a PhD student in the Department of Computer Science at the University of Toronto, where I am jointly supervised by [Prof. Sven Dickinson](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~sven/) and [Prof. Allan Jepson](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~jepson/). Previously, I was a Sr. Research Engineer at the Samsung Toronto AI Centre, where I worked on multimodal interaction and metric learning. My current research interests broadly span reinforcement learning, information theory and active vision.
