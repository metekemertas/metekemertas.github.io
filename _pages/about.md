I am a PhD student in the Department of Computer Science at the University of Toronto, where I am jointly supervised by [Prof. Sven Dickinson](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~sven/) and [Prof. Allan Jepson](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~jepson/). Previously, I was a Sr. Research Engineer at the Samsung Toronto AI Centre, where I worked on multimodal representation learning and information-theoretic metric learning. 

In 2017, I completed my [MScAC](https://mscac.utoronto.ca/) at the University of Toronto with a focus in natural language processing and machine learning. Prior to that, I obtained my Bachelor's degree in Electrical Engineering with a minor in Software Engineering from McGill University. Before joining Samsung in 2018, I worked at technology startups in Toronto and Montreal as a machine learning engineer and software developer.

My current research interests broadly span reinforcement learning, information theory and active computer vision.
