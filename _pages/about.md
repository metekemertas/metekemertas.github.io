I have recently (July 2025) joined Amazon as a Member of Technical Staff with the [AGI Autonomy group](https://www.amazon.science/blog/amazon-opens-new-ai-lab-in-san-francisco-focused-on-long-term-research-bets) in San Francisco, working on agents. I am also a PhD Candidate in Computer Science at the University of Toronto and the [Vector Institute](https://vectorinstitute.ai/), jointly supervised by [Allan Jepson](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~jepson/) and [Amir-massoud Farahmand](http://academic.sologen.net/bio/). My research interests include large language models, reinforcement learning, and computational optimal transport.

Prior to my PhD (May 2018 – Sep 2020), I was a Senior Research Engineer (Staff I MLE) at the [Samsung Toronto AI Centre](https://research.samsung.com/aicenter_toronto) led by [Sven Dickinson](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~sven/), who co-supervised the first half of my PhD. At Samsung, I worked on representation learning for computer vision and vision-language integration. Before that, I spent 1.5 years at startups in Canada as a software developer and machine learning engineer. 

In 2017, I completed my [Master of Science in Applied Computing](https://mscac.utoronto.ca/) at the University of Toronto with a focus on natural language processing and machine learning. I received my Bachelor's degree in electrical engineering with a minor in software engineering from McGill University.

My research philosophy emphasizes truth and precision over marketability/hype. I aim to approach scientific inquiry by continuously questioning assumptions, striving to maintain a balance between theory and empiricism, and remaining rigorously skeptical about everything I read and write. To [quote](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OL6-x0modwY) Richard Feynman from his famous lectures on physics:

> *"If it disagrees with experiment, it’s wrong. And that simple statement is the key to science. It doesn’t make any difference how beautiful your guess [theory] is, it doesn’t matter how smart you are who made the guess [derived the theory], or what his name is... If it disagrees with experiment, it’s wrong. That’s all there is to it."*
