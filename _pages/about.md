Mete Kemertas is a PhD student at the Department of Computer Science, University of Toronto and the [Vector Institute](https://vectorinstitute.ai/). He is jointly supervised by [Allan Jepson](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~jepson/) and [Amir-massoud Farahmand](http://academic.sologen.net/bio/). His research interests include theoretically-sound algorithms for reinforcement learning with a particular focus on state abstraction and representation learning methods. Previously, he was a Senior Research Engineer at the Samsung Toronto AI Centre (2018-2020), where he worked on representation learning and metric learning for computer vision and vision-language integration. In 2017, he completed his [Master of Science in Applied Computing](https://mscac.utoronto.ca/) at the University of Toronto with a focus in natural language processing and machine learning. He holds a Bachelor's degree in electrical engineering with a minor in software engineering from McGill University. His research is supported by the NSERC CGS D scholarship.
