I am a PhD Candidate at the Department of Computer Science, University of Toronto and the [Vector Institute](https://vectorinstitute.ai/) jointly supervised by [Allan Jepson](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~jepson/) and [Amir-massoud Farahmand](http://academic.sologen.net/bio/). My research interests include model-based reinforcement learning and computational optimal transport. Previously, I was a Senior Research Engineer at the Samsung Toronto AI Centre (2018-2020), where I worked on representation learning and metric learning for computer vision and vision-language integration. In 2017, I completed my [Master of Science in Applied Computing](https://mscac.utoronto.ca/) at the University of Toronto with a focus in natural language processing and machine learning. I received my Bachelor's degree in electrical engineering with a minor in software engineering from McGill University. My research is supported by the [NSERC CGS D scholarship](https://www.nserc-crsng.gc.ca/students-etudiants/pg-cs/cgsd-bescd_eng.asp).
